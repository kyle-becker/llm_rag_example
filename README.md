This project involves the creation of a rag large language model using langchain, pincone vector database and the llama 2.7B parameter model through amazon bedrock.

This example splits the toy dataset into chunks and uploads to the vector database.

The user is able to add a prompt and ask for a specific toy they are looking for and the rag model will return the most likely toys along with key metadata from the database
